        <li><strong>1939</strong> - A day after United Kingdom declared war on Germany, Turing joined the Government Code &amp; Cypher School where he was a lead participant in breaking German cypher techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>1940</strong> - With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic.</li>
        <li><strong>1943</strong> - Alan is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology.       </li>

	    <li><strong>1949</strong> - Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University.</li>
	    <li><strong>1950</strong> - Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will become very famous.</li>
	    <li><strong>1952</strong> - Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him.</li>
